# About

This project is a fullstack project made with Node JS and Vanilla JS. The goal of this project is to create a SNMP tool that is easy to use. I will use this library here: **https://www.npmjs.com/package/net-snmp**

# Installation
If you are on Windows you can simply run the batch file-> SNMP.bat

If you are not on Windows or its not working just follow the steps below:
1. Check if you have already installed Node JS
If not, you can download it here: **https://nodejs.org/en/download/**

```
node -v
```


2. Start the server
In the CMD go to the folder where you this project is and run this command

```
node app.js
```

3. Now you can open under the frontend folder the file index.html in a new Browser tab.
You should be able to use the application :)
# Next Steps
- add a Set function to the back/frontend
- make the scan network function also possible with a /16 and /8 subnet
- catch and display errors on the frontend
- fix some styling issues
- refine and improve CSS
- simplify the backend functions
- simplify the frontend script -> perhaps split the script into multiple files

# Other goals
- add more SNMP functions
- add more animations to the frontend
- make the frontend more user friendly
- make the frontend with React
- add more informational pages to frontend
